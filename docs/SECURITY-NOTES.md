# Atlas Verifier — Defended Attack Surface (V1.5)

This document describes what the V1.5 verifier (`atlas-trust-core`, exposed as
`atlas-verify-cli` and `atlas-verify-wasm`) actually defends against. It is
written for auditors and security reviewers who want to know "what does this
verifier protect, and where are the limits" without reading Rust.

If you are an auditor reading this for the first time: every claim below is
backed by an integration test in `crates/atlas-trust-core/tests/golden_traces.rs`,
a unit test in `crates/atlas-trust-core/src/`, or an issuer-side test in
`crates/atlas-signer/src/anchor.rs`. You can run them all with
`cargo test -p atlas-trust-core -p atlas-signer` against any clone.

## What the verifier guarantees

When `verify_trace(trace, bundle)` returns `valid: true`, the following hold:

1. **Schema match** — the trace's `schema_version` exactly equals the verifier
   build's `SCHEMA_VERSION`. Substring/prefix tricks (e.g. `"atlas-trace-v1-extended"`)
   are rejected, not accepted.
2. **Bundle pinning** — the trace claims `pubkey_bundle_hash` and the verifier
   has independently computed the same hash from the supplied pubkey bundle.
   Comparison is constant-time (`subtle::ConstantTimeEq`).
3. **Hash-chain integrity** — every event's claimed `event_hash` was recomputed
   by the verifier from the canonical signing-input bytes; the comparison is
   constant-time. Two events sharing an `event_hash` are rejected as a
   duplicate.
4. **Signature integrity** — every event was signed with `EdDSA` by the
   private key corresponding to its `kid`'s pubkey in the pinned bundle.
   `signature.alg` MUST equal `"EdDSA"`; any other value (including blank,
   `"none"`, `"RS256"`, etc.) is rejected without attempting to verify.
5. **Timestamp wellformedness** — every event's `ts` parses as RFC 3339.
   (V1 does NOT enforce monotonicity or maximum drift — see *Out of scope*.)
6. **DAG integrity** — every `parent_hash` referenced by any event resolves
   to some other event in the same trace; the computed DAG-tips match the
   server's claimed `dag_tips`.
7. **Workspace binding** — `workspace_id` is folded into the canonical
   signing-input alongside `event_id`, `ts`, `kid`, `parents`, and `payload`.
   An event signed inside workspace A cannot be replayed inside workspace B
   without breaking the hash check (cross-workspace replay defence).
8. **Anchor verification** — for every entry in `trace.anchors`, the
   verifier recomputes the RFC 6962-style Merkle inclusion proof from
   the leaf hash up to the claimed root and verifies the Ed25519
   checkpoint signature against a pinned log public key. The
   leaf-hash domain prefix (`leaf:` vs `node:`) prevents second-preimage
   attacks across tree levels. Two anchor kinds are recognised:
   `bundle_hash` (defends against post-hoc bundle swap) and `dag_tip`
   (defends against tail truncation or fork). Empty `anchors[]` passes
   by default (no claim is fine, but a false claim is not);
   `VerifyOptions::require_anchors` strict mode demands at least one
   anchor and that every `dag_tip` be covered by a `dag_tip` anchor.

## Wire-format determinism

The signing-input is encoded as deterministic CBOR per RFC 8949 §4.2.1
("Core Deterministic Encoding"):

- Map keys are sorted by **encoded-key length first**, then bytewise lex.
  (Pure lex sort, the previous V0 behaviour, diverges from §4.2.1 once
  keys of mixed length appear.)
- Floats are **rejected** at the canonicaliser boundary. Float encoding is
  not deterministic across CBOR variants and not stable across float
  libraries. Callers must use bounded integer encodings (e.g. basis points)
  for fractional values. The bank demo encodes `training_loss = 0.0814`
  as `training_loss_bps = 814`.
- Per-level item count is bounded by `MAX_ITEMS_PER_LEVEL = 10_000`,
  capping `Vec::with_capacity` allocation under hostile input.
- All wire-format structs (`AtlasTrace`, `AtlasEvent`, `EventSignature`,
  `AnchorEntry`, `TraceFilters`, `PeriodFilter`) carry
  `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]`. Unknown fields fail the parse.

Three pinned anti-drift properties lock the trust model at the build
step:

- `crates/atlas-trust-core/src/cose.rs::signing_input_byte_determinism_pin`
  locks the exact CBOR bytes of the per-event signing-input for a known
  input. Any unintentional change to the canonicalisation pipeline —
  including a `ciborium` upgrade that subtly changes encoding — trips
  this test before the WASM/native split can reach a customer's browser.
- `crates/atlas-trust-core/src/pubkey_bundle.rs::bundle_hash_byte_determinism_pin`
  locks the exact blake3 hex of `PubkeyBundle::deterministic_hash` for a
  known bundle. The bundle hash is the *second* load-bearing identity in
  the trust model: it is what a trace claims via `pubkey_bundle_hash` to
  bind itself to a specific keyset. If the canonicalisation drifts
  (a `serde_json` upgrade altering `Number::to_string()`, a whitespace
  tweak, a key-sort regression), historic bundles silently stop matching
  new builds — exactly the "silent rotation" threat Atlas is built to
  prevent. This pin trips first.
- `crates/atlas-signer/src/anchor.rs::mock_log_pubkey_matches_signer_seed`
  asserts that the issuer-side `MOCK_LOG_SEED` and the verifier-side
  pinned `MOCK_LOG_PUBKEY_HEX` derive to the same Ed25519 keypair.
  Touching one without the other fails CI — preventing the silent class
  of bug where the issuer rolls a new key but the verifier still pins
  the old one (or vice-versa). The same pinning model generalises to
  V1.6, where the operator pins one or more live Sigstore log
  identities; the verifier path is unchanged.

All three pins enforce the same contract: changing them requires a
crate-version bump so the `VERIFIER_VERSION` cascade propagates and
old-format inputs are rejected with a clean schema error rather than
silently misverifying.

## Adversary tests

Each of the following is an integration test in
`crates/atlas-trust-core/tests/golden_traces.rs`:

| Test | Adversary intent |
|---|---|
| `cross_workspace_replay_rejected` | Trace signed for workspace A, presented as workspace B → hash mismatch |
| `anchor_with_bogus_proof_is_rejected` | Trace claims an anchor whose Merkle proof does not reconstruct to the signed checkpoint root → ✗ INVALID |
| `wrong_alg_rejected` | `signature.alg = "RS256"` (downgrade attempt) |
| `non_rfc3339_timestamp_rejected` | `ts = "yesterday at noon"` |
| `duplicate_event_hash_rejected` | Two events share the same `event_hash` (replay collision) |
| `dag_tip_mismatch_rejected` | Trace claims a tip the events do not produce |
| `schema_version_prefix_attack_rejected` | `schema_version = "atlas-trace-v1-extended"` (substring trick) |
| `empty_pubkey_bundle_rejected` | Bundle with zero keys → first event's kid is unknown |
| `bundle_hash_mismatch_rejected` | Trace was signed against a different bundle than the verifier holds |
| `tampered_payload_detected` | Payload mutated after signing |
| `unknown_kid_detected` | Bundle missing the kid the event claims |
| `schema_mismatch_detected` | `schema_version = "atlas-trace-v999"` |

Plus unit-level adversary tests across `cose.rs`, `hashchain.rs`,
`pubkey_bundle.rs`, and `anchor.rs` (float rejection, RFC 8949 sort,
dangling-parent, key-insertion-order independence, byte-pinned bundle
hash, RFC 6962 audit-path-length conformance, leaf-hash domain
separation, checkpoint-bytes stability).

Issuer-side adversary tests live in
`crates/atlas-signer/src/anchor.rs`:

| Test | Adversary intent |
|---|---|
| `tampered_anchored_hash_fails` | Anchor entry's `anchored_hash` is mutated post-issuance → verifier-side proof check fails |
| `mock_log_pubkey_matches_signer_seed` | Issuer seed and verifier-pinned log pubkey would silently drift → CI breaks before either reaches main |
| `round_trip_single_leaf` | Single-leaf tree: leaf is the root, audit path is empty, verifier accepts |
| `mixed_kinds_round_trip` | One batch with mixed `bundle_hash` + `dag_tip` kinds verifies under one shared checkpoint |
| `round_trip_seven_leaves_every_index` | Non-power-of-two tree, every leaf index verifies against the same root |

## Out of scope (V1.5)

The following are **not** defended in V1.5, and a `valid: true` outcome
does NOT imply them:

- **Live Sigstore Rekor submission.** V1.5 ships an offline-complete
  anchoring path: the issuer in `atlas-signer` is a deterministic
  mock-Rekor that emits real RFC 6962 inclusion proofs and Ed25519
  checkpoint signatures, and the verifier validates them against a
  pinned log public key. The "mock" qualifier means *no live network
  call to a public Rekor instance* — every other property is identical
  to a production transparency log. V1.6 swaps the issuer for a real
  Rekor POST behind `--rekor-url`; the verifier path is unchanged
  (the pinned-pubkey rule generalises to "operator pins one or more
  trusted log identities").
- **Anchor-chain tip-rotation.** V1.5 anchors the current `dag_tips`
  and the current `pubkey_bundle_hash`, but consecutive anchors are
  not yet linked into a hash-chain-of-hash-chains. V2 ships
  cross-anchor referencing so a server cannot rewrite past anchored
  state without breaking the chain.
- **Timestamp monotonicity / drift bounds.** The verifier checks that `ts`
  parses as RFC 3339 and nothing more. Future-timestamps and out-of-order
  events both pass V1.5.
- **Cedar policy enforcement.** Trace bundles list `policies[]` but V1.5
  does not evaluate them.
- **SPIFFE attestation.** `kid` strings of the form `spiffe://...` are
  treated as opaque keys-of-id. SVID validation against an in-domain
  trust bundle is not implemented.
- **Side-channel attacks beyond hash equality.** Constant-time compare
  is wired on hash and bundle-hash equality. Other code paths (CBOR
  encoding, JSON parsing, Merkle proof recomputation) make standard
  branching choices.

## Crate boundary

The verifier crates (`atlas-trust-core`, `atlas-verify-cli`,
`atlas-verify-wasm`, `atlas-signer`) are licensed Apache-2.0. An auditor
or regulator who receives an Atlas trace bundle is free to fork, build,
and run them under Apache-2.0, with no obligation under the
Sustainable Use License that governs the server, web frontend, and MCP
server in `apps/`.

This is the load-bearing trust property of Atlas: any third party can
independently verify a trace bundle without buying anything from us.

## Reporting issues

Verifier vulnerabilities — bypasses, signature-acceptance bugs,
canonicalisation drift, side-channel leaks — should be disclosed
privately to nelson@ultranova.io. We will respond within 48 hours.

A vulnerability that lets a forged trace verify as `valid: true` is the
worst possible class of bug for this project; we take such reports
seriously and will publish a fix + advisory on a co-ordinated timeline.
